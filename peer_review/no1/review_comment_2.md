# 再査読コメント
I checked the revised manuscript and author's response to reviewer's comments.
Although some points have improved, this paper has still very difficult problem to be acceptable for publication and is not revised enough based on the comments.
From this reason, the final judgement is "D" (reject).
I think this paper needs to be radically rewritten after reconsidered deeply in terms of originality and usability.
Detailed reasons and comments are as follows: 


# [major reasons]
## major reason1 (General)
The creativity is slightly improved according to reviewer's comment. 
Especially, the proposed PSO is changed to be added some SHADE's operators according to Reviewer A's comment and Reviewer B's major comment7.
And, the sentence about the originality of this paper is added to Section1 according to Reviewer B's major comment2.
However, I think the originality and creativity of this paper are still low according to the following points.
- Point1
   - Even if the above change, the proposed PSO is just a hybrid algorithm of the conventional PSO and many conventional operators as pointed out by Reviewer A.
   - The creativity is not acceptable for publication of this journal.
- Point2
   - To my understanding, the objective of this paper may be not an new algorithm assuming versatile application environments but an effective algorithm to the path planning problem.
   - In spite of Reviewer B's major comment 2, there are no the essential difference between the proposed PSO and other algorithms.


## major reason2 (Section4)
However, it is still unclear whether their operators or ideas have the effectiveness for the path planning problem through numerical experiments.
While Reviewer B's major comment5 points out a necessary to combination of some ideas including the SHADE's operator, the experimental results in Section4 of the revised manuscript cannot show the necessary without comparing the LDIWM PSO in Subsection 3.2 and the original SHADE in Subsection 3.3.
If the original SHADE
This is critically 
there are not the validation comparing to original for usability .
しかし、数値実験を通して、各オペレータは経路計画問題において効果があるかどうかが未だに不明瞭である。
査読者Bの照会事項5は、SHADEを含め、各アイディアを組み合わせる必要性を指摘しているが、
修正原稿の4章の数値実験は、3.2節のLDIWM PSOや、3.3節のオリジナルSHADEとの比較がないため、その必要性を示すことができていない。
さらに、
よって、提案手法の意義を裏付ける検証が不十分である。



## major reason3 (General)
There are many insufficient explanations for the readers and this may cause them confused or misleading. I think there are too many needed points to rewrite or revise according to the following points.
- Point1
   - While Reviewer B's major comment 2 pointed out "Please clarify the optimization problem consisted of the objective function, the constraint condition, and the design variables.", there are not clear explanation of the design variables in this revised paper.
- Point2
   - What is the FPSO in Section4?



# [minor comments]
## minor comment1
The answer or response letter is too simple.
The author should refer all sentence from the reviewer and replay to them point by point.
